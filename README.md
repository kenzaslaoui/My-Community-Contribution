# My-Community-Contribution
Data Visualization Project 

In this project, I explore how to make data visualizations for Color Blind individuals. I explore how to use different patterns, shapes and sizes to make categories differentiable without the use of color. I also look into using packages such as "RColorBrewer", "dichromat", and "colorBlindness" to access and use color blind friendly colors on your existing plots. I also use the "colorblindcheck" and "dichromat" packages to simulate color blindness and visualize colors and plots from the perspective of a color blind individual.

You can find my code in this repository and can also watch a video I made on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzD8F0ucCOI)
